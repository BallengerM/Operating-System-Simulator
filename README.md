# Operating-System-Simulator
Designed an OS simulator in C#. Semester long project where a new section of the project was released every week to every two weeks. 
Had to adapt to changing project requirements and adjust previous versions of the project in order to adapt for the new part of the project. 
Started with a basic shell and built up to memory access and process scheduling.
